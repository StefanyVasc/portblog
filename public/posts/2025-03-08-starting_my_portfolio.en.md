# 🚀 Building My Portfolio – Part 1: The Journey Begins

The idea of having a **professional portfolio** had been in my mind for a while, but I wanted something that went **beyond a static résumé site**. I wanted a space that could **grow with me**, showcase my craft, and host the articles and experiments I enjoy writing.

So I turned the process into a mini series: I’ll document every milestone while I build this portfolio from scratch. 🚀

## 🎯 Portfolio Goals

When outlining the project, these objectives led the way:

- **Tell my story and highlight core skills** in a concise, honest way.
- Deliver an **interactive experience**, not just a list of links.
- Embed a **blog** so I can share learnings, projects and challenges.
- Practice **frontend architecture and design systems** the way I like to code day to day.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

To keep things modern and flexible I picked:

- **📦 Framework:** React + Vite + Radix UI
- **📍 Routing:** React Router
- **⚡ State:** Context API (with room to add SWR/Zustand later)
- **📝 Markdown Blog:** Static markdown files rendered at runtime
- **🚀 Hosting:** Likely Vercel or Netlify

## 📝 What This Series Will Cover

This is the roadmap I’m following (and writing about):

✅ **Project Structure** – folders, linting, type-safety and tooling.  
✅ **Home Page** – layout decisions, accessibility, interactions.  
✅ **About Page** – telling my story, highlighting technologies and milestones.  
✅ **Markdown Blog** – loading metadata + markdown, rendering and styling.  
✅ **Dark Mode** – toggles, tokens and accessibility considerations.  
✅ **Deploy & Optimizations** – shipping fast with good performance defaults.

## 💡 Closing Thoughts

I’m excited to share the ride (and break things along the way). If you’re building a portfolio too, feel free to follow along, reuse snippets, or simply keep me company. ✨

📌 **Up next:** project scaffolding and the very first components.

See you in the next chapter! 🚀🔥
